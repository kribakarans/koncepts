## 1. Binary Tree
Each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children.

### Types of Binary Tree:
Binary Tree consists of following types based on the  number of children:
1. Full Binary Tree
2. Degenerate Binary Tree

On the basis of completion of levels, the binary tree can be divided into following types:
1. Complete Binary Tree
2. Perfect Binary Tree
3. Balanced Binary Tree

## 2. Ternary Tree
Each node has at most three child nodes, usually distinguished as “left”, “mid” and “right”.

## 3. N-ary Tree (Generic Tree)
 1. Many children at every node.
 2. The number of nodes for each node is not known in advance.

# Special Types of Trees in Data Structure based on the nodes’ values:
## 1. Binary Search Tree

### Properties:
1. Left node is lesser than root node
2. Right node is greater than the root node
3. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree

## 2. AVL Tree

### Properties:
AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees for any node cannot be more than one.

## 3. Red-Black Tree
## 4. B-Tree
## 5. B+ Tree
## 6. Segment Tree
